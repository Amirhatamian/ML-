# Image Compression and Anomaly Detection on ECG5000

## Overview
This project focuses on two key tasks:
1. Image Compression: Using machine learning models to reduce the size of image data while retaining essential information.
2. Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in the ECG5000 dataset, a dataset of Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings.

## Features
- Image Compression: Implementation of deep learning techniques for efficient image representation.
- Anomaly Detection: Leveraging machine learning to identify outliers in ECG data.
- Data Visualization: Use of plots and visualizations to interpret results effectively.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - numpy: For numerical computations.
  - matplotlib: For data visualization.
  - tensorflow: For deep learning and model building.

## File Structure
- Notebook: Contains the code and detailed explanation for both tasks.
- Data: Includes the ECG5000 dataset and any other required datasets.
- Outputs: Generated models, compressed images, and anomaly detection results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
